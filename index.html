			<h2>Travel - Paris - Tips and tricks </h2>

					  	 Paris can be an incredibly expensive city. It is, after all, renowned for its luxury goods, gourmet restaurants, opulent palace hotels, and the like. Because of this, you may (logically) assume that seeing Paris on a budget isn't realistic, or would amount to a miserable experience that'd leave you feeling like a pauper.
						Luckily, however, that's all a myth: a visit to Paris really doesn't have to break the bank. It's entirely possible to eat well, find clean and decent accommodations, and enjoy discounted and free attractions while still having the sense that you're living it up in one of the world's most gorgeous cities. A (fun) budget Paris vacation doesn't have to belong to the realm of fairy tales, after all: read on to find out why.
